### Choosing a License
It is important to choose an appropriate license to ensure content is treated in a manner intended by the creator. A license is a written set of rules that explicitly states in what context the content can be used and modified. It offeres guidelines that are necessary for a vast pool of contributors that need to know how they can affect the original material and how they can subsequently distribute that material, modified or not.

### Avoiding projects without an explicit license
If contributors do not abide by an explicit license when working on a project, the rules for modifying and distributing content are unclear. Consequently this increases the risk of sabotage and wrongful use of content unintended by the creator.

### Why the Web beat Gopher Reflection
In the article Richard Stallman is quoted as saying, to paraphrase, that a software license agreement has no place in open-source development. Given the context of the Web's early stages of development, his argument seems to have merit although misguided in the larger scheme of where software development stands today. A license does not have to be seen as a pair of cuffs binding developers' hands from writing code but a set of guidelines as stated above. The article brought up a valid claim that Gopher failed to follow the movement of the software development community, which in the early stages of formation was extremely important considering the pace of exploration into personal computing at the time. The problem seems to be that Gopher had its own vision that involved not only serving the community but an evolution of their own brand as well. If this comes at the risk of scraping against the community's prevailing opinion then personal growth is stifled but the industry itself stands to benefit more with wider adoption of standards.

### Justifying Linux license use
The GNU GPL v2 license is appropriate for Linux because it enables mass distribution and modification in a way that can support an operating system and the host of issues maintaining and developing for one can bring. The license needs to be general enough to allow for proper development, testing and redistribution necessary for specialized Linux instances but guarantee no liability can be held for damage.

### Project Proposal
I would like to create a ride-sharing / hailing app that is primarily used for fraternity social events to organize drivers taking students to Greek commons housing. I believe that it is a tool that can be used by many students at RPI and by most fraternities and social organizations that require an administrative account to manage multiple drivers. This way, the fraternity can assign a driver for the night and dictate when the shift begins and ends and the driver can dictate when he is on break or cannot take any drivers. I hope to create an open source web application with a maps UI first and then try to port it to iOS and Android when I gain the necessary experience and the application is stable enough to run on web. The main users would be students wishing to hail a ride to a Greek house, Greek brothers/sisters using the application to keep track of ride requests and receive messages from the fraternity/sorority if need be, and Greek organizations wishing to have administrative access to their members for assigning and keeping track of drivers for a given night. I want to use the MIT License to try and keep things free and open to solicit rapid development and testing.
